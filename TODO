Check that deactivated content doesn't show in feed.
While it makes sense to keep shows for at least a month, does it make sense to keep episodes as no feed relies on them... there might be a mismatch if their id had changed - nope, we basically don't use episode id since the episode element in the feed just links to the page with the content on the source/channel site. Seems 1.month might be a bad compromise between keep old shows for 3-6 months (if the same show name might pop up again after a summer they might want their feed id to be the same) and delete immediately for episodes. On the other hand, slugs will make all of this irrelevant... or will it, what if names duplicate... actually if names duplicate at the moment all eps would go in the same feed... but only within a channel, if two channels have the same show or the same name for a show we'd need... to append channel name or channel id which wouldn't later change. i.e. we can always regenerate the same show feed slug if we delete it and it pops up again... but, if we delete a show the moment there's no data for it, user's would get an error on the show feed and be prompted to unsubscribe which they might not bother to otherwise, then resubscribing later would be annoying. i.e. even if we have slugs we want to delay deletion for at least 4 months (summer plus a bit) unless we blow our 5MB free heroku db limit. Also, if we're going to do slugs we need to do it before launch or additionally be backwards compatible with ids for feed urls forever.
