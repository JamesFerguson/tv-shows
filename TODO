Check that deactivated content doesn't show in feed.
While it makes sense to keep shows for at least a month, does it make sense to keep episodes as no feed relies on them... there might be a mismatch if their id had changed - nope, we basically don't use episode id since the episode element in the feed just links to the page with the content on the source/channel site. Seems 1.month might be a bad compromise between keep old shows for 3-6 months (if the same show name might pop up again after a summer they might want their feed id to be the same) and delete immediately for episodes. On the other hand, slugs will make all of this irrelevant...
